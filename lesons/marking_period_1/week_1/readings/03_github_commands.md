Here we will cover different commands that you can use when working with Github!
 
git add . = stages changes in code to be committed
 
git commit -m "[commit message]" = creates the commit that previous command staged
 
git push = pushes your commits to the remote repository/branch (sends it to github)
 
git clone = copies the repository to a specific folder on your computer; copy and paste the URL right after typing this command.
 
git pull = pulls down the changes from the remote repository into the branch you're in (you can use git pull to access lessons)
 
git pull origin master = fetches a copy of the master branch from the original repository, then merges it with your current branch. 
 
git remote -v = tells whether or not your folder is a repository
 
git checkout [name of branch] = switches you to another branch
 
git checkout -b [name of branch] = creates a new branch based on the code you're on
 
git fetch = retrieves changes from Github for your computer to recognize.
 
git merge = merges specified branch with branch you're currently in.
 
git stash = temporarily saves any changes you make in your repository, and allows you to re-apply those changes later.
